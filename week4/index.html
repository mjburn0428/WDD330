    <h1>Week 04 Learning Notes</h1>
    
    <p>This week I learned about coding styles. I know when I was beginning into the web development scene 
      I would do rookie mistakes such as 

      if (n < 0) {alert(`Power ${n} is not supported`);} 

      Now I do this:

      if (n < 0) {
     alert(`Power ${n} is not supported`);
    }

    By applying this last style the code is much easier to read and understand.

    I also learned early on indenting code. If your code is indented it will need to follow suit with the rest of the code. 
         
    </p>
    

    <h2>Programming basics</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>
            Funtion placement is where if you write several helper functions and the code that uses them
            there are a few ways to organzize the functions.
        </li>
        <li>
        // function declarations
          function createElement() {
  ...
            }

            function setHandler(elem) {
  ...
            }

            function walkAround() {
  ...
            } 
            
            // the code which uses them
            let elem = createElement();
            setHandler(elem);
            walkAround();

        </li>
        <p>
           You must write the code first then write the functions. 

           // the code which uses the functions
          let elem = createElement();
          setHandler(elem);
          walkAround();

          // --- helper functions ---
          function createElement() {
  ...
          }

          function setHandler(elem) {
  ...
          }

          function walkAround() {
  ...
          }
        </p>
        <p>
          The second variant is preferred most of the time when writing code and functions. 
          When reading code we want to know and understand what the code actually does. If the code 
          goes first then it is much clearer from the start on what the code and function
          do.     
        </p>
        <li>  
        </li>

    <h2>Team notes</h2>
    <p>
          I have had a minor conflict with my team this week. I think we might have resolved it,
          but the issue is we aren't able to meet together which has been problematic this last four weeks
          of the semester. So I have been tackling projects as I have seen and feel comfortable doing.
          
          I think it's a cultural difference but I hope we will work it out. I am meeting finally with one member this Saturday
          Yay!
        </p>
