    <h1>Week 09 Learning Notes: Storage</h1>
    
    <p>
    This week I learned about Local Storage and Session Storage. For Session Storage
    the data will survive and be there after a page refresh, and for Local Storage a full
    restart of the browser. 

    Both Storage Objects have the same methods and properties such as 
    setItem(key,value)
    getItem(key)
    removeItem(key)
    clear()
    key(index) 
    length

    We can use a plain object to obtain or set keys like this,
    //This sets the key  
    localStorage.test = 3;

    // This obtains the key
    alert( localStorage.test ); // 3

    // This removes the key
    delete localStorage.test;

    We can also loop over keys. Storage objects are not iterable. We can use an
    array to loop over them such as,

    for(let i=0; i<"localStorage.length"; i++) {
    let key = localStorage.key(i);
    alert(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
    }

    We can filter fields which hasOwnProperty such as:
    
    for(let key in localStorage) {
    if (!localStorage.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    continue; // skip keys like "setItem", "getItem" etc
    }
    alert(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
    }

    As a note both key and value must be strings. If it were another type such as 
    a number or an object it would get converetd to a string automatically.
    We can use JSON to store objects 

    localStorage.user = JSON.stringify({name: "John"});

    // sometime later
    let user = JSON.parse( localStorage.user );
    alert( user.name ); // John

    Session storage is used less often than local storage. The properties and methods
    will be the same but very limtied. Session storage exists within the browser tab.
    Another tab with the same page will be stored different in a different storage.

    To sum it all up. Both value and ley need to be strings. Depending on the browser the limit
    is 5mb. The storage of local and session have no expiration, and finally the data is bound to the 
    orgin of the domain,port,or protocol.

    Local storage survives a browser restart while session storage survives a page refresh but not when the 
    tab is closed.

    <h2>Programming basics: Drawing Graphics</h2>
    <ul>
            <p> 
           This week I found out web browsers contain some powerful graphics programming tools from the SVG language. It is 
           possible to use it as a canvas. You can add images to a canvas, have amazing graphics such as 2d grpahics, you can draw 
           shapes and many many other things. To start you'll need a code similar to the below. 

        <canvas width="320" height="240">
            <p>Description of the canvas.</p>
        </canvas>

        To utilize this, you must make a local copy of the canavs start directory which must contain
        three files, the index.html, script.js, and the css style sheet. 

        You can also create loops to play animations within the canvas. The loops are similar to below

        ctx.fillStyle = `rgba(${255 - length},0,${255 - length},0.9)`;
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.moveTo(moveOffset, moveOffset);
        ctx.lineTo(moveOffset + length, moveOffset);
        const triHeight = length / 2 * Math.tan(degToRad(60));
        ctx.lineTo(moveOffset + length / 2, moveOffset + triHeight);
        ctx.lineTo(moveOffset, moveOffset);
        ctx.fill();

        length--;
        moveOffset += 0.7;
        ctx.rotate(degToRad(5));

        To play animations we will create a loop but request it through an animation frame. 
        function loop() {
        ctx.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)";
        ctx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);

        for (const ball of balls) {
        ball.draw();
        ball.update();
        ball.collisionDetect();
        }

         requestAnimationFrame(loop);
    }

    loop();

    There are many different things you can do with the graphics of a browser within the code. From a 
    simple drawing applicaiton to a simple animation of a person walking. (Oregon Trail game style)

    <h2>Team notes</h2>
    <p>
        This week I assisted in implementing the admin login. I created a placeholder to get to the admin index
        page, but then I revised the button to look a bit more profesisonal. I worked on product color swatch but couldn't figure it out.
        I started on the image resize. However I am pleased with the image resize already. 

        </p>
