        1.What did I do since the last meeting? I finished the admin login for Sleep Outside. So far it works as intended. </li>

        <li>2.What am I going to do next? I started working on the final portofolio for this course. I have started work on the index.html and needed files for the final project.
            
        </li>

        <li>3.What are my blockers? My blockers this week was working with the team. My team members really made me upset this last week. I was working on the final bits of the project and yet 
            one of them had an condescending attitude with me. I went back and was appaled at the attitude. This whole semester they expected me to communicate with them, and they never communicated with me 
            until there was an urgent matter and I attemtped to reach out to them to no avail. Really bugged me working with my assigned team this semester. The whole I am better than you attitude 
            and the attitude and tone when I would communicate with them was totally uncalled for. Needless to say I am glad our team project is over as this was a huge blocker all semester.
