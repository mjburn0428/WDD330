    <h1>Week 10 Learning Notes: Functions Execution Contexts</h1>
    
    <p>
    This week I learned about Functions. Principles of Javascript. It is taking the words which intreprets the words
    on how the web browser works. It parses line by line. It is storing variables in the memory. 

    Once the code is written, we use it as an execution context. It is the space in which is to execute the code which takes it line
    by line.  The threa in javascript goes from top to bottom and never skip a line. Order line by line is the order to be followed. 
    Also one function at a time. Single threaded. 

    When you execute a function you create a new execution conext which compromises of
    the thread of execution and a local memory. 
    
    </p>

    <h2>Programming basics: Global/Return/Call Stack </h2>
    <ul>
            <p> 
           When we call the function we have an arguement. It will return the value of the result into the global variable output. 

            A call stack is a similar to an array. A stack is great for tracking how things work. When we call a function it is called a call stack.
            It is a great way of representing how the functions work. It will grab a piece of data in the area, which tracks the execution contexts. We keep 
            track of the fucntions being called in Javascrip with a Call stack. 

            It has one global execution context with multiple function contexts.
