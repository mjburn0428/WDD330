        1.What did I do since the last meeting? We had a discussion on what projects we were 
        going to be working on in our Trello board backlog. I created an alert.js file which will show 
        an alert on the sleep outside.</li>

        <li>2.What am I going to do next? I plan to work on the total in cart and am coming up with a formula for 
        calculating the total. Once I finish the alert I will be working on that.</li>

        <li>3.What are my blockers? My blockers are still trying to be able to communicate effectively with my team.
        We have good communicaiton but meeting times have not been the best. I am understanding Trello and GitHub more.
