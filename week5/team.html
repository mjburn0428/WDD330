        1.What did I do since the last meeting? I created the alert.js file as well as the checkout button and checkout js file.
    I think i took on a bit too much. I disregarded the total. </li>

        <li>2.What am I going to do next? I plan to continue working on the  checkout.js and finalze the finishing 
            touches on it. 
        </li>

        <li>3.What are my blockers? My blockers this week are a struggle. I had a conflict with a team member 
            who made it sound like I was not contributing at all which I have been. I told both my team members that 
            I have contributed and prefer meeting over text as text can get misunderstood and misinterpreted. I am meeting 
            with a team member tomorrow.
