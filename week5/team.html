        1.What did I do since the last meeting? I helped Landon work on debugging code. Landon and I 
    came to the conclusion Anderson's intial code was a bit off. We worked for two hours on 2/4. We would 
squish one bug then we would have about 5-6 more bugs and issues. </li>

        <li>2.What am I going to do next? I am working on implementing a search feature for the sleep outside site. 
            
        </li>

        <li>3.What are my blockers? My blockers this week were a bit of a struggle. Betwwen my hectic work scheudle as well, 
            as my other classes and my obligations I stay pretty busy. However I am grateful Landon and I are able to meet. 
            I also am still learning javascript. It is pretty fun to say the least. I love the 
            Javascrip.info website. It is super informative, more so then mozilla. 

            It is interesting, I am the CEO of the worlds oldest and largest virtual airline in the flight 
            simulation community. A virtual airline is a community where members who share the same passion of aviation 
            and flight simulation learn and grow in the hobby. Anyways I work closely with my VP of Technology
            who designed the entire website code base on java. We are discussing revamping it and adding new modern implementations 
            for the future. I am trying to learn more so I can help with this endeavor.
