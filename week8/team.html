        1.What did I do since the last meeting? I went in and refactored the code and added expanded inventory with breadcrumbs. I added an alert banner
    as well as styling it. </li>

        <li>2.What am I going to do next? I am going to continue working on the sleep outside website and get the backlogs down on Trello. 
            
        </li>

        <li>3.What are my blockers? My blockers this week were I am a perfectionist and want things to be perfect. I strive for that. I forgot and had to research how to add a 
            interval timer for the alert. I could not remember how to. Back to the books for me.
