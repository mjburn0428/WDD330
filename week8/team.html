        1.What did I do since the last meeting? I started work on the product colors card. I think I might have a way to get it to work properly. </li>

        <li>2.What am I going to do next? I am planning working on the Discoutn flag on product details page. We have the products discounted already within the price.
            
        </li>

        <li>3.What are my blockers? My blockers this week were time management. I had a lot occur this week both at my job and also within
            the Virtual Airline which I am CEO of. I started early on the team project for class but I got slammed busy with so many issues 
            it took a bulk of my time.
