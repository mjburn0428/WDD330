    <h1>Week 08 Learning Notes</h1>
    
    <p>
    This week I learned about JSON webtokens or JWT for short. JWT are an open standard
    which defines a compact and self contained way to securely transmit information and data 
    between parties which operates as a JSON object. The information can be verified 
    and trusted because of a digital signature. JWT's are signed using a HMAC or a public
    or private key using RSA. 


    </p>
    

    <h2>Programming basics: When to use JWT's</h2>
    <ul>
            <p> 
            When JSON webtokens are useful when one needs to have an Authentication method and exchange of information.

            Authentication is the typical scenario for when to use a JWT once a user is logged in. Each 
            request  will incldue the JWT allowing the user to access services, routes, resources which are 
            permitted within the token. Single Sign On is a feature which uses JWT a lot.

            Information Exchange JWT's are an excellent way of securly transmitting information between 
            users which is effective because it is signed. Some code snippets include


            {
             'alg': 'HS256',
            'typ': 'JWT'
            }
            This is the payload Base64Url

            {
             'sub': '1234567890',
             'name': 'John Doe',
             'admin': true
            }
            This is the signature. 
            
            To create the signature
              HMACSHA256(
                base64UrlEncode(header) + '.' +
                base64UrlEncode(payload),
                secret)

                eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
                
                The above is the JWT which has a header and payload encoded and it is signed with a secret. 
            </p>

        This week I made some adjustements to the sleep outside page. Landon redid and styled the checkout button for me.
        He told me I did an excellent job on the checkout form. I felt it could've been better but it works and that's all that 
        matters to me.
