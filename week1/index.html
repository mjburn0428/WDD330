   <h1>Week 01 Learning</h1>
    <p>This week I learned a bit about Git and what the functions are used when using Git. So Git is a tool that performs a function of code version control in a distributed way, of which several features stand out, such as:</p>

    <ul>

        <li>
        Quick branch management, because Git predicts that a change would be merged far more frequently than it was originally planned.
        </li>

        Quick branch management, because Git predicts that a change would be merged far more frequently than it was originally planned.  
        </li>
        <li>Distributed management; Changes are imported as extra branches, which can be merged in the same way that the local branch can.</li>
        <li>
        Project management that is effective.
        </li>
        <li>
        Package replenishing on a regular basis.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </main>
    <p>There are two types of Version Control Systems, Centralized and Distributed.
Centralized Version Control Systems (VCS), such as Subversion, which is a tool that has been trusted to house version revision history, is a centralized point, which can lead to a loss of work if we lose network connectivity.
    </p>
    <p>Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) get around this problem. Some examples of distributed systems, apart from Git, are Mercurial, Bazaar, or Darcs. In these types of tools, clients fully replicate the repository.</p>

    <h1>Week 01 Questions</p>
    <ul>

    <li>
    I am guessing Trello is like a project work board for our teams to see where the project status is?  
    </li>

    <li>
    Is there a tutorial for Trello?
