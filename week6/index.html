    <h1>Week 06 Learning Notes</h1>
    
    <p>This week I learned about forms. As I was working on the team project, I did a lot on the project.
        I created the form for the checkout, I worked on and created the expanded inventory which pulls the 
        products from the json files. I then created a checkout button which allows a user to submit their
        shipping info and payment info.

        In learning about submit, event method I studied this code
            
        let form = document.createElement('form');
        form.action = 'https://google.com/search';
        form.method = 'GET';

        form.innerHTML = '<input name="q" value="test">';

        // the form must be in the document to submit it
        document.body.append(form);

        form.submit();
    </p>
    

    <h2>Programming basics Sending a simple form</h2>
    <ul>
            <p><form id="formElem">
  <input type="text" name="name" value="John">
  <input type="text" name="surname" value="Smith">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

<script>
  formElem.onsubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    let response = await fetch('/article/formdata/post/user', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: new FormData(formElem)
    });

    let result = await response.json();

    alert(result.message);
  };
</script></p>
        
        

    <h2>Team notes</h2>
    <p>
        I went in and refactored a good bit of our code. Last week Lando and I met and we encountered many bugs. We would squish one then another six bugs would appear.
        I went in and fixed it plus added new features such as search and expanded inventory. 

        </p>
