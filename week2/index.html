    <h1>Week 02 Learning Notes</h1>
    
    <p>It is interesting that one can execute a script with a command such as "node my.js" JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into 
        HTML code using the script tag. I found it interesting that the script can be executes and display a message in the webpage. You can also run external
        scripts as long as you use the correct src tag and path to the script.
    </p>
    <h2>Programming basics</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>
            The pages are made up of three key important factors, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is easily to get confused if your code is all jumbled up near each other. I find it better to 
            write each statement of code on a new line. Such as below
        </li>
        <p>
            const message = ‘Hello World’;
        </p>
        <p>
            alert(message);
        </p>
        <li>I learned how to import. Import you have to put import {/...,} such as 
            import {sayHi, sayBye} from 'path/folder/say.js'
        </li>
        <li>
            You can also import "as" such as import {sayHi as hello, sayBye as goodbye} from 'path/folder/say.js'It will then replace 
            the word instead of hi it will be hello.  
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Object Method Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>It the code below it used a Function Expression to create a function and assign it to a property of the object.
    <p>let user = {
            name: "Joe"
        age: 35
    };</p>
        <p>user.sayHi =function(){
            alert('Hello')
        };
    user.sayHi(); //Hello!
    </p>

        <li>
            Functions that are stored in object properties are method
            Methods allow objects to act like objects
            Methods can reference the object.
        </li>
        <li>
            When a function is declared it may use this but it will have zero value until the function is called.
            A function can be copied
            When a function is called in the method the value of this is called the object
        </li>
    </ul>
